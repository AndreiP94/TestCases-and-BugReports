# TestCases-and-BugReports Repository

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of test cases and bug reports that I have personally developed. It is designed to document and organize issues and testing strategies for various software applications and websites.

## Contents
There are two main types of documents in this repository:

### 1. Bug Reports
Each bug report provides detailed information about specific issues encountered during software testing, including:
- Description of the bug.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected versus actual outcomes.
- Priority and current status of the bug.

### 2. Test Cases
The test cases are structured to ensure software functionality and performance before releases. Details in these documents include:
- The purpose and description of the test.
- Step-by-step procedures for conducting the test.
- Expected results.
- Necessary test data.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to maintain a personal record of testing efforts and identified software issues. It serves as a reference point for understanding the types of problems that can occur in software development and how they can be systematically tested and documented.

## Personal Note
As the sole contributor to this repository, I have created and maintained all the contents as part of my ongoing learning and development in software testing. This repository is basic and serves as a practical tool for my personal use in software testing and debugging.
